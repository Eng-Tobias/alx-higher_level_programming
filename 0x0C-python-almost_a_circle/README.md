# Almost a Circle

## Description

This project implements classes for geometric shapes, focusing on rectangles and a base class for ID management. The classes allow for creating, manipulating, and representing rectangles in a 2D space.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Base Class
- Implemented a base class that manages an `id` attribute.
- Each instance of the class has a unique ID, with the option to set it manually.

### 2. Rectangle Class
- Created a `Rectangle` class that inherits from the base class.
- The class includes attributes for width, height, and position (x, y).
- Implemented getters and setters to ensure proper encapsulation of attributes.

### 3. String Representation
- Added methods to return string representations of the instances for easier visualization.

### 4. Unit Tests
- Developed unit tests for the base and rectangle classes to ensure functionality.
- Tests validate the behavior of constructors, attribute access, and method outputs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5 or higher
- `pycodestyle` for style checks
- `unittest` for running tests
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
