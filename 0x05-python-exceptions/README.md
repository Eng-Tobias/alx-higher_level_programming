# Python Exceptions

This project demonstrates the handling of exceptions in Python through various tasks.
This project contains Python functions that handle exceptions and demonstrate safe operations with lists and integers.

## Tasks

1. **Safe list printing**: Print a specified number of elements from a list, handling cases where the list is shorter.
2. **Safe printing of an integers list**: Print an integer safely, returning True or False based on the operation.
3. **Print and count integers**: Print integers from a list while counting how many were printed.
4. **Integers division with debug**: Perform division of two integers while handling division by zero.
5. **Divide a list**: Divide two lists element-wise, handling exceptions like division by zero and type errors.
6. **Raise exception**: Raise a TypeError.
7. **Raise a message**: Raise a NameError with a custom message.
