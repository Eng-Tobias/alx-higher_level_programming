## Tasks

### Task 0: Run Python File

**Objective**: Write a shell script that runs a Python script.

**Details**:
- Create a Python file named `main.py` that prints "Best School".
- Create a shell script named `0-run` that runs the Python script using the environment variable `PYFILE` to specify the script.

**Files**:
- `main.py`: Contains the Python code to print "Best School".
- `0-run`: A shell script that executes the Python script specified by the `PYFILE` environment variable.

### Task 1: Shell Script Examples

**Objective**: Various shell scripts that accomplish specific tasks.

**Details**:
- Shell scripts should be exactly two lines long.
- Files should end with a newline.
- First line of all files should be `#!/bin/bash`.

### Task 2: C Programming Examples

**Objective**: C programs that adhere to specific coding standards and guidelines.

**Details**:
- All C files should be compiled using `gcc` with specific options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Follow the Betty style guide for coding and documentation.
- Include header files with function prototypes and use include guards.
