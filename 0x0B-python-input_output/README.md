# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

## Description

This project is about learning how to handle files in Python, specifically reading, writing, appending, and working with JSON. The tasks involve creating Python scripts that perform various file operations and ensuring they follow proper coding standards and conventions.

## Learning Objectives

- How to open, read, write, and append to files in Python.
- Understanding file handling using the `with` statement.
- How to serialize and deserialize data using JSON.
- Ensuring Python code follows the `pycodestyle` guidelines.

## Project Structure

### Mandatory Tasks

1. **0. Read file**  
   Function: `read_file(filename="")`  
   Reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout.  

2. **1. Write to a file**  
   Function: `write_file(filename="", text="")`  
   Writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written.

3. **2. Append to a file**  
   Function: `append_write(filename="", text="")`  
   Appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added.

4. **3. To JSON string**  
   Function: `to_json_string(my_obj)`  
   Returns the JSON representation of an object (string).
